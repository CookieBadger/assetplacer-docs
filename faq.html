<section id="is-there-some-trial-or-demo">
<h2>Is there some trial or demo?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-there-some-trial-or-demo" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There is! The first AssetPlacer version was originally developed for an academic thesis, which you can check out <a class="reference external" href="https://cookiebadger.itch.io/assetplacer#:~:text=87%20kB-,Development%20log">here</a>.
It includes a demo for the plugin, that was patched to fix bugs and support newer Godot versions.
You can use this demo to see if the plugin works for you. By buying the full version you support my work and ensure that more updates will be developed in the future.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-is-this-not-entirely-free">
<h2>Why is this not entirely free?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-this-not-entirely-free" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We all love open-source software like Godot for its accessibility and the freedom it gives to users. We then make games with it, which are - in most cases - commercial.
Of course, game devlopers have fun while making games, in the best case, but they still have to pay their bills, thus charging for their work is perfectly valid.
Many commercial platforms for acquiring assets, such as 3D models exist as well, such that artists can be remunerated for their work, even though it should fit a general purpose.</p>
<p>This plugin is neither a game, nor does it contain assets for a game, but still months of development time have been spent to make it as useful as possible.
As gratification alone cannot buy any food or pay rent, this plugin is being given away for a small amount of money.
Considering the time you can save by using it, especially when using modular assets, it seems like a very fair price to me.
The plan is, to keep developing the plugin, by adding new features and maintaining compatibility with major engine versions.
As you receive the source code of the plugin directly, you are also free to make any changes as you see fit, if you ever need to change something.
Your freedom of use is as unlimited as I can make it, and as much as I would like to give the plugin away for free entirely, I am grateful for everybody who appreciates my work by buying it fairly.
I might release other plugins as Open-Source in the future. Buying this plugin would also support my work in this endeavor.
In case that you really do not want to pay for a tool, you can check out this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Frontrider/Godot-Scene-Browser">Open Source Alternative</a> for Godot 3.</p>

<section id="i-can-only-find-the-c-version-where-is-gdscript">
<h2>I can only find the C# version. Where is GDScript?<a class="headerlink" href="#i-can-only-find-the-c-version-where-is-gdscript" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>At the moment, this plugin is written in C# only. The choice to develop it in C# was made, because of the large amounts of code and the frequent use of abstraction and high-level language features.
This is much easer to handle with a powerful language with a powerful external IDE. As you might be aware, C# code can only be run in the Mono version of the Godot engine, which requires <a class="reference external" href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0">.NET</a> to be installed, which might be annoying for some of you.
I am sorry for this inconvenience. Maybe I will translate the plugin to GDScript eventually, but for now it is the way it is.</p>

<section id="is-there-a-way-to-use-this-plugin-for-2d-levels">
<h2>Is there a way to use this plugin for 2D levels?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-there-a-way-to-use-this-plugin-for-2d-levels" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Currently, the plugin only features tools for 3D levels, but I thought about adding tools for 2D as well. Separating the AssetPlacer into an AssetPlacer3D and a AssetPlacer2D (i.e. having two bottom panels) would be an option, that might be implemented in the future.</p>
</section>
<section id="godot-3-x">
<h2>Godot 3.x?<a class="headerlink" href="#godot-3-x" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>No, sorry.</p>
</section>
<section id="i-added-the-plugin-but-i-cannot-enable-it">
<h2>I added the plugin, but I cannot enable it!<a class="headerlink" href="#i-added-the-plugin-but-i-cannot-enable-it" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Make sure to press the “Build” button at the top right before you enable the plugin. If the button does not show up, create a new C# script in your project and delete it again. It should show up now.
Once you built the plugin without errors (check the build output), you should be able to enable it in the project settings.
In case this does not fix a problem, make sure you followed the instructions in the <a class="reference internal" href="installation.html"><span class="doc">Installation page</span></a>, and then  <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/CookieBadger/assetplacer-docs/issues/new">create an issue on GitHub</a> or write a comment on <a class="reference external" href="https://itch.io/t/3066159/levels-and-environments-youve-made-with-assetplacer">itch</a> describing your problem and I will do my best to help!</p>

<h2>What can I use the source code for?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-can-i-use-the-source-code-for" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>You bought the plugin, then you own it. You can modify the source code however you see fit, use it for any amount of projects on any number of machines.
If it somehow is of use to you, you may also use parts of the code inside any game you are making.</p>

<p>There is no restriction to the usage, use it in any amount of projects for as long as you want! As long as the plugin is still in development, you will also receive accesss to any updates bringing new features, or compatibility with newer engine versions.</p>
</section>
<section id="i-found-an-issue-with-the-plugin-where-should-i-report-it">
<h2>I found an issue with the plugin. Where should I report it?<a class="headerlink" href="#i-found-an-issue-with-the-plugin-where-should-i-report-it" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>To report any errors or problems you might encounter using the plugin, please <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/CookieBadger/assetplacer-docs/issues/new">create an issue on GitHub</a> describing the problem. In case you do not have a GitHub account, you can also write a comment on the <a class="reference external" href="https://itch.io/t/3066159/levels-and-environments-youve-made-with-assetplacer">itch</a>  page.</p>

<section id="you-should-implement-this-and-that-also-i-had-an-idea-for-another-tool">
<h2>You should implement this and that! Also, I had an idea for another tool!<a class="headerlink" href="#you-should-implement-this-and-that-also-i-had-an-idea-for-another-tool" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>As described in the other answers, you can always <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/CookieBadger/assetplacer-docs/issues/new">create an issue on GitHub</a> or comment on the <a class="reference external" href="https://itch.io/t/3066159/levels-and-environments-youve-made-with-assetplacer">itch</a> page of the plugin.
Please take into account, however, that the focus of the development might lie in improving stability, and thus bugs will be prioritized over features.
Also, not every feature is feasible to implement, since this is a one man project, and requests might also be declined for features that might only serve a specific use case or a very limited amount of users.</p>
